In the step, we will use the symmetric key generated in step 1 along with text(password) that we want to encrypt. 

We use the cipher_suite.encrypt() function for generating a ciphered text from the string:
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
key = b'Generated Symmetric Key'
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
ciphered_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(b"SQLShack@DemoPass")   
print(ciphered_text)

In the output of the SQL Notebook, it prints the ciphered text, and we can store this password in SQL Server tables. 
SQL Server does not recognize this encrypted text, so if anyone gets access to the table also and read passwords, he cannot be authenticated by SQL Server:
