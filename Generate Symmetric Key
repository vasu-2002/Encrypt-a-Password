We use the fernet module in the cryptography package. It guarantees that no one can read the encrypted text without the symmetric key. 
We generate a symmetric key using the generate_key() function of the fernet module.

Fernet is an accessible and most useful secured primitive in the cryptography. It is suitable for small texts and files. 
We cannot use it for more extensive texts in GBâ€™s. It encrypts or decrypts the texts in the memory.

The following code generates a symmetric key in SQL Notebook and prints it: 
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
key = Fernet.generate_key()
print(key)

Output is a URL safe base64 encoded key. Note down the symmetric key and store it in a safe location.
